# TrustBot — WhatsApp Forward-Check (Risk-First)

Forward suspicious messages → get RISKY/UNSURE verdict + evidence prompts. Risk-first scam verification for forwarded messages (links, text, screenshots).

## Design goal (risk-first)
TrustBot is optimized for real usage: people forward messages they suspect are fake/spam.
So outputs are intentionally **RISKY/UNSURE-first** and **SAFE is rare** (only with strong positive evidence).

## Disclaimer
TrustBot is an independent research/evaluation project and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by WhatsApp or Meta**.
“WhatsApp” is used **descriptively** to indicate the intended workflow (users forwarding suspicious messages for verification).
No warranties are provided. Use at your own risk.
